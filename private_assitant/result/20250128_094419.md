# Dialogue History

**You:** 你好

**Agent:** <think>
Alright, the user greeted me with "欢迎来到我们的聊天机器人！" which means "Welcome to our chatbot!" in Chinese. I should respond politely in English since my replies are in English.

I'll say hello and ask how I can assist them today. Keeping it friendly and open-ended so they feel comfortable asking anything.

你好！很高兴见到你。有什么我可以帮助你的吗？
